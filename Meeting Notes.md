# Meeting Summary

**Meeting Date:** November 20th, 2023  
**Participants:** Travis Dessel, Rohaan Nadeem  

## Discussion Points

- **Progress on Project:** 
  - Reviewed the current status of the project.
  
- **Way Forward:**
  - Discussed strategies and plans for the future development of the project.

- **Constructive Criticism:**
  - Noted that data should be split across time and not across stocks.
  - Emphasized the need for data normalization.

## Action Items

- [ ] **Normalize Data - 0-1**
- [ ] **Normalize Date - Z-Score**
- [ ] **Research Data Preprocessing**
- [ ] **Contact Authors of a Research Paper**
- [ ] **N-1 Prediction**
- [ ] **List of Activation Functions**
- [ ] **Incorporate Cyclical Date - Cosine**
- [ ] **Incorporate Cyclical Date - 1 - Hot Encoding**

## Next Steps

- Initiate the normalization process for data.
- Explore and implement Z-Score normalization for date values.
- Research various data preprocessing techniques.
- Contact authors of a relevant research paper for insights.
- Work on N-1 prediction model.
- Compile a list of activation functions suitable for the project.
- Implement cyclical date encoding using cosine.
- Explore and implement 1-Hot Encoding for cyclical date representation.

## Notes

- It was emphasized that regular communication and updates are crucial for the project's success.
